# dci
A PHP Data Context Interaction (DCI) library.

This library is really just an example use of my [jstewmc/transient](https://github.com/jstewmc/transient) library which allows methods and properties to move between objects at run-time. 

See the [`tests` directory](https://github.com/jstewmc/dci/tree/master/tests) for a concrete DCI example.
